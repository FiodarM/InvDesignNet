Neural Network for Inverse Design in Nanophotonics
==================================================
This project demonstates training neural networks for inverse design of nanophotonic gratings.

Generating dataset
------------------
* Prior to training networks you have to generate the dataset.
* To generate the dataset you can run `produce_data.py` script or `produce_data.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.

Forward Model
-------------
* See `forward_model.ipynb` Jupyter notebook for loading, training, and saving forward model
* Saved forward model states can be found in `forward_model` folder.
  
Inverse Model
--------------
* See `inverse_model.ipynb` Jupyter notebook for loading, training, and saving forward model
* Saved inverse model states can be found in `inverse_model` folder.
